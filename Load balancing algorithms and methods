Load balancing algorithms and methods
Load balancing uses various algorithms, called load balancing methods, to define the criteria that the ADC appliance uses to select the service to which to redirect each client request. Different load balancing algorithms use different criteria.
The Least Connection Method 
The default method, when a virtual server is configured to use the least connection, it selects the service with the fewest active connections.
The Round Robin Method
This method continuously rotates a list of services that are attached to it. When the virtual server receives a request, it assigns the connection to the first service in the list, and then moves that service to the bottom of the list.
The Least Response Time Method
This method selects the service with the fewest active connections and the lowest average response time.
The Least Bandwidth Method 
This method selects the service that is currently serving the least amount of traffic, measured in megabits per second (Mbps).
The Least Packets Method 
This method selects the service that has received the fewest packets over a specified period of time.
The Custom Load Method
When using this method, the load balancing appliance chooses a service that is not handling any active transactions. If all of the services in the load balancing setup are handling active transactions, the appliance selects the service with the smallest load.
